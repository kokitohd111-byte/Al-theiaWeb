        <h1>Development Report</h1>

        <p><b>Welcome to my Development Blog!</b> Here you will find information about our reports.
            Currently, we are working on an RPG Maker MZ game.
        </p>

        <p>My name is Gabffee and my coworker's name is Ezequiel. 
           We're indie developers, and this is our first project.
           We started working on this idea a few days ago, and we are very glad to show you 
           <b><i>"Succubous Blood"</i></b>.
        </p>

        <h1>"Succubous Blood"</h1>

        <p>
            <b><i>Succubous Blood</i></b> is a game that tells the story of someone… 
            or maybe something more.

            The game will focus on four characters at first:
            <b><i>Bianka, Asher, Teresa and Kanai</i></b>.

            I was working on the game's movement system.
            Now the player can move not only with arrow keys,
            but also with W, A, S and D.

            Next, I worked on the ZOOM_SCALE feature.
            This allows the player to see the screen better
            across different maps in the game.
