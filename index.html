        <p>My name is Gabffee, the organizer of <b>“Succubus Blood.”</b>, The game is currently in development.
            I’m planning to release the game on itch.io first, and later on Steam, if the opportunity arises.
            I would love to release the demo this year, if possible.

            <br> <br>

            I will be posting a report every week so you can stay up to date with the game’s progress and also 
            get a closer look at the development process.

            seemingly quiet town. 
            Motivated by his grandmother, the protagonist’s family decides to move far away from the noisy city.
